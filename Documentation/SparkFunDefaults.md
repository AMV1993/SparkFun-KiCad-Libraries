## pcbnew and 3D viewer settings

These are held in the file named "kicad" within %appdata%/roaming/kicad
 
Settings file sets up colors for pcbnew and the 3D viewer.  A user should select either SparkFun_Green_PCB or SparkFun_Red_PCB from /Tools/SparkFun_UI_Defaults/ and copy it to their roaming folder.

### pcbnew

Both versions use the same settings as default but with a couple changes:

* Paste layer changed to pop out a bit
* F.SilkS and B.SilkS chosen as light grey
