$CMP 6_PIN_SERIAL_TARGETSMD
D 6-pin header connection for use with the "FTDI BASIC" pinout - TARGET SIDE.  Also known as "Arduino Serial Program Header".  It is used to mate with our FTDI Basic serial programmers using the Arduino IDE.  <b>Note, this device has "TARGET" in the name.</b> It is intended to be used on a design that contains a target micro-controller that you wish to program.  <b>The "sister" device, named "CABLE"</b> is inteneded to be used on a design that usually lives on the end of your USB cable and prvides the converter chip (FTDI232 or FTDI231x) to commnicate serial RX/TX. <b>You can populate with some of these:</b><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116"> Break Away Headers - Straight</a> (PRT-00116)  For reference (or to suit your programming needs) check out these designs:<ul><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716"> SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout - 5V</a> (DEV-09716)</li><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873"> SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout - 3.3V</a> (DEV-09873)</li><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12935"> SparkFun FTDI SmartBasic</a> (DEV-12935)</li><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13746"> SparkFun Beefy 3 - FTDI Basic Breakout</a> (DEV-13746)</li></ul>

Because they are alternating, it causes a "brace" to hold the component in place.  0.005 has proven to be the perfect amount of "off-center" position when using our standard breakaway headers.
